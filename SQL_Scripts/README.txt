These SQL scripts are primarily the DDL used to provision the Postgres metadata tables and the external (S3 based) Hive tables for production data. Also included in the hive_configuration.sql file is a custom Hive Serde that we experimented with for deserializing the JSON. However, we quickly realized that the api did not always conform to a single schema. This Serde was unable to account for these changes and a custom deserializer was written in Java.
