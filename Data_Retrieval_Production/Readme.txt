Java files in this folder were used for pulling weather data from www.openweathermap.org and storing the same in Amazon S3.

All the necessary keys and URL are configured in the codebase. 

Following are the steps for executing the code base.

1. These files will have to be run a linux server with Java 1.7 installed

2. Create a directory by name weather in the root directory (/weather). It is important to creat under the root folder.

3. Copy code and data directories under weather folder

4. Change directory to code 

5. Run run_weather.sh

6. Data pulled will be stored in data folder as well as copied to S3



Below are the some of the configuration information. This for information only.
