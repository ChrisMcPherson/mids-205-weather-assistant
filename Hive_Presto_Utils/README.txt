The Hive_Presto_Insert_Test.java file was used to verfiy and test the code necessary to connect and execute DDL statements against both Hive and Presto. It was also used to compare the performance of Hive vs Presto. Presto was identified as the superior query engine for our use case, so this test is left in a state suitable for running statements against our Presto implementation in EMR.
